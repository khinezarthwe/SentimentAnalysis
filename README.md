### Project Submission
#### Project Overview

- Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

#### Project Instructions

- The deployment project which you will be working on is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In particular, it is assumed that you have a working notebook instance in which you can clone the deployment repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
```

##### Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!

```
(1) MAKE A BETTER WEB APP
The web app that you make in this project simply reports to the user whether the predicted sentiment was positive or negative. Can you think of a better web app that uses the same model?

(2) IMPROVE THE WEB APP APPEARANCE
The provided web app is very simple and there is plenty of room for improvement if you wish to stretch your web developer skills.

(3) IMPROVE THE MODEL
The model chosen here is a straightforward RNN with a single hidden layer. There are many different model architectures that you could try to see if they improve the results.
